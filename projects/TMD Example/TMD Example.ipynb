    "There are a lot of details to directly configuring `PWInput`, `PWOutput`, and `PWCalculation` objects, so some nice helper functions are provided, similar to `mpquery_helper` for `MPQuery` objects.\n",
    "These are `dftmanlib.pwscf.pwinput_helper` and `dftmanlib.pwscf.pwcalculation_helper`. **However, almost always, `pwcalculation_helper` will be most convenient.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from calculation parameters, pseudopotentials are another critical input to DFT calculations, and they are selected by manually creating a `pseudos` dictionary or using `dftmanlib.pwscf.pseudo_helper`, which allows selecting a pseudopotential family from the collection of families provided by DFTman. These include [Standard Solid State Pseudopotentials (SSSP)](https://www.materialscloud.org/discover/sssp/table/efficiency), [Garrity-Bennett-Rabe-Vanderbilt (GBRV)](https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/gbrv/), [PseudoDojo (DOJO)](http://www.pseudo-dojo.org/) potentials with a variety of ultrasoft, norm-conserving; LDA, and GGA exchange-correlation functionals.\n",

    "* `SubmitJob` is used on nanoHUB for remotely submitting to the nanoHUB cluster\n",
    "* `PBSJob` can be used on any cluster running the a Torque PBS system\n",
    "* `LocalJob` runs the calculation locally, e.g. in a nanoHUB workspace, on a cluster workspace, or on a local workstation\n",
    "\n",
    "`Jobs` generally require the following inputs:\n",
    "* A `Calculation` object which has the necessary properties described in `dftmanlib.base`, e.g. `PWCalculation`\n",
    "* Which program to use. This is implemented differently in different types of `Job`.\n",
    "* Resource parameters describing how many processors, nodes, and which queue to run on. These also vary slightly depending on the type of `Job`\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to figure out what specific inputs a type of `Job` needs is to run `help(JobClass)` where `JobClass` is the type of `Job` you're interested in (e.g. `help(SubmitJob)`)\n",
    "\n",
    "`Jobs` should be automatically stored in the database when they are run, but often when their data are updated, they are **not** automatically updated in the database, to improve performance. Make sure you update jobs in the database by running `job.update()` at critical points in your code, like when you check a job's status or parse its output."

    "### Loading Jobs from the Database\n",
    "When `Job`s are run, they are automatically stored in the project database, located at `$DFTMAN_ROOT/projects/PROJECT DIRECTORY/db.tinydb`. DFTman uses the [TinyDB module](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage flat-file JSON-encoded document-based databases. DFTman implements a modified storage protocol based on the [monty module](http://guide.materialsvirtuallab.org/monty/)'s MSON encoder and decoder to automatically convert MSONable python objects to and from serializable python dicationaries. All of this is to say that you can directly store and retrieve Python objects like `Job`s which have `from_dict()` and `as_dict()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database is organized by tables (think books in an excel document) which are named after the type of thing that they store. For example, the `'SubmitJob'` table stores `SubmitJob`s, and the `'PBSJob'` table stores `PBSJob`s. So, for a project using `SubmitJob`s, the way to load the appropriate database table is the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "db = load_db()  # This is from dftmanlib.db\n",
    "table = db.table('SubmitJob')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this is useful for storing input and output information for all `Job`s and `Workflow`s run using DFTman. A lot of information about how to get and query for database entries is listed in the [TinyDB documentation](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), but the simplest way to load `Job`s into the programming environment from the database is to use the `TinyDB.table.get()` method with a `doc_id` (which is printed and returned whenever something new is added to the database).\n",
    "\n",
    "Any time a project's notebook is shut down, all the variables and data stored in the python environment are lost. So, in order to check on the status of submitted `Job`s or load completed `Job`s and their output, they must be loaded from the database back into the python environment."

Other managers use programs called daemons that run in the background to check the status of calculations, but DFTman cannot do this. There are generally three ways to check `Job` statuses:\n",
    "* Queue status functions like `dftmanlib.job.submit_status()` provide information on **currently running** jobs and are the fastest status functions.\n",

    "### Retrieve Output\n",
    "When `Job`s complete successfully (and often when they complete unsuccessfully), their output can be parsed and brought into the programming environment using `job.parse_output()`. Behind the scenes, this function calls the `Job`'s `calculation.parse_output()` which in turn creates a new instance of the calculation's output class which is passed back up the chain. In the case of Quantum Espresso PWscf, this means creating a `PWOutput` object which provides many of the outputs in the pw.x stdout.\n",
    "\n",
    "`job.parse_output()` always check's if `job.status['status'] == 'Complete'`, so it is important to ensure that `job.check_status()` is called before trying to parse output and that the job is up-to-date in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the properties provided by `PWOutput`, use `help(PWOutput)` and look under Data Descriptors.\n",
    "To list the entries in `PWOutput.data`, use `display(list(dftmanlib.pwscf.pwoutput.patterns.keys()))`"
